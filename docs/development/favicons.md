Favicons
========

Generate your favicon in different sizes. For the current state of affairs check out ["Favicon Generator - For real"](https://realfavicongenerator.net/). All favicon files should be located in the document root directory.

There are also images used for [Microsoft's `browserconfig.xml`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/dn320426(v=vs.85).aspx).

Favicons can be generated by calling `gulp build-icons` from your projects base directory.

OG:Images
---------

Every page should have it's own preview image, referenced by this code:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="{{BASE_URL}}{{IMAGE_URL}}" />
```

According to Facebook this image should be at least 200Ã—200 pixels.
